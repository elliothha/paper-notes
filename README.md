# Machine Learning Paper Notes
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/elliothha/paper-notes)

*[3/16/24 Update]:* 

*Currently still a senior in college dying with my workload, so transferring my handwritten notes to markdown files won't be started until I have time (read: who knows?) to rigorously go through all my work and the papers again. So currently, this repo will just serve as a place to document and sort the papers I've read into their respective categories. Think of it as a mind-map of sorts except a really shitty one in a markdown file. Anyway, really hoping I get a job in this field so I don't have to ever leave it.*

*With love,*

*Elliot*

Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes) and [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).

Intended to be a space for my notes on research papers that I've read. The overall goal is to have my notes be comprehensive enough in intuition and rigorous enough in math that I wouldn't have to refer to the actual paper when working on a topic unless I needed to lookup something specific. 

Long-term goal is to eventually turn these notes into posts for my blog as well as videos hopefully capturing the intuitive style of 3b1b. 

Somewhat doing this for posterity's sake as I want a permanent record of the things I've done/read/built (human nature, I guess?), but mostly because I simply just love this stuff and want to share that with others.
